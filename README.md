## OVER VIEW OF PROJECT :
### PROJECT :DIGITAL LOGIC DESIGN WITH VERILOG
- ### Objective:
Digital logic design with Verilog is a fundamental aspect of hardware design and verification in digital systems.
Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model and simulate digital circuits.
Hereâ€™s an overview of digital design with Verilog, including key concepts, typical components, and design and verification processes.
- ### Key Activities
- **Verilog: A widely used HDL for modeling digital systems. It provides a way to describe the structure and behavior of electronic systems at different levels of abstraction.
- **Behavioral: Describes what the system does, using high-level constructs like if, case, and for loops.
- ## Technology used
 Simulation Tools: ModelSim
 - ## output wave forms
